Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data set

Files CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

merges the training and the test sets to creat one data set
extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
